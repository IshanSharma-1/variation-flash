- 52 deck of cards
- different game variations from the list shared below, totally randomized but first 3 games of all sessions by deafult will be normal game (all game types mentioned below):
- everyone will have like coins around 50 in the start.
- each person can choose whether they want to play this one circle blind or they wanna see their cards (this mandatory at the start of every game - only for just the starting round/turn of all players.)
- plan in advance before the turn even begins(before cards are even shuffled), for blind players, they will need to add 2 coins in  the common bowl, if the player wants to see it, they then need to add only 1 coin - max blinds are set to 2 per game
- cards are shuffled to all players based on the game decided to play - game name highlighted above along with the time in the current game.
- then we go around the table, where the person turn is highlighted in a circle sitting manner - 2d only
- they can pack or give 2 coins in bowl to let everyone know they are playing.
- if they pack, it means they wont have cards till the game ends.
- they go circle and circle, they can pack and play.
- when only 2 players are left - we give them an option to show (asking the other player to show their cards) to continue playing their turn of 2 coins per turn.
- lastly if the person wins, he gets all the coins accumulated during that particular game.
- the players decide which game to play next
- the player sitting on the left hand side of the player has to add 1 coin + 1 coin since the previous person sitting anticlockwise next had won and game continues.

what all logic we need:
- shuffling cards as per the game since each game may need 3 or 4 or 5 cards.
- when game is having 5 cards, no one is allowed to play blind and all players have to add only 1 coin each to begin the game.
- if players are <8, remove empty slots and make sure each player added coin before shuffling and distribution of cards even begin.
- random card distribution for all games for fair play
- random game type allotment but first 3 games by default will be normal.
- if a player looses all coins, his balance turns negative
- all coins go to a bowl
- 1 coin is worth Rs. 10
- after cards are distributed to all players, keep the pending cards in the middle, nearby the bowl

what all assets we need:
- 52 deck of cards
- ui elements best in class
- shuffling cards animations
- best in class ui/ux
- hosting on github pages
- putting coins in a bowl - animation of coins going in a bowl
- a round structure of playing - maybe a circle denoting player's name or whatever looks visually appealing
