==============================================================================================================================================

Game Logic:

    AI
        - AI Model gets better and better for players reaching levels 1 to 360
        - Whatever number of players the main player selects, AI will take place and play the game
        - Cards logic for teen patti will be shared for AI to understand
        - Every game, every AI player will have a different name, out of a combination of billions - a random username that never gets repeated for anyone playing
        - They will have their own Avatars to choose from (which will also be available for the human player as well)
        - Dynamic thinking time: ranging between 1 to 7 seconds to make sure human never gets to know whether the opponent is AI or actual human
        - Ability to self pack (probability is 4%) or keep on playing (mature enough to understand if it should play cards or not)
        - Exploit human to take more bets
        - If AI's money is less than the chaal/turn, add a dynamic waiting time of 3 minutes to show they're buying money with real coins
        - Same time for human also, giving them options to choose b/w 100-1000 coins and then route them to pay that much real money to buy that
        - AI nature has to be dynamic to make game fun at all times and keep hooking up players

    Showdown/During Game:
        - Deduct one coin before card distribution for players playing seen (available in career mode)
        - Deduct one extra coin before card distribution for players playing blind (available in career mode)
        - After distribution, deduct 2 coins for normal/seen and 1 coin for blind playing players during 2nd cycle (1st cycle: turn moves from person 1 to person n {n is the number of ai players playing} and we don't deduct coins during the 1st cycle, i.e. FOR EXAMPLE, Card Distributed, turn of P1-P2-P3-P4-{round 2}P1(deduct)-P2(deduct)-and so on) (available in career mode)
        - We don't deduct any coins for players from round 2 onwards who are pack (available in career mode)
        - AI and/or Human(Main Player) can keep playing blind and have the opportunity to double or triple the amount of each coin
        - Show dynamicism of the AI to add new twist in each game
        - Back Show: AI and/or Human(Main Player) can ask the person before them (i.e., player n-1. if player is at position 1, it can ask person from the last of the array, be it the last player, second last etc.) - only if >2 players are left
        - Back Show contd: Whose cards are 'stronger' will continue, the other one goes pack and we can see their cards.
        - Back Show: player/AI has to put same number of coins as seen/normal for back show
        - Back Show: If someone (AI/human) asks for back show, Can be defused/refused (then no coins charged, continue playing BAU) or taken (same number of coins for normal charged as per the match)
        - AI and/or human players can ask for show if 2 players are left. one can defuse/continue/chaal or show

    Lobby
        - When a player decides to play b/w any contest and any number of players, show a 'waiting for other players' lobby.
        - UI/UX: Ambient, soft music played. this is basically a loading screen. load time can be b/w: 5 to 60 seconds, majorly should be 10 seconds for best UX
        - 1 in 150 times, show that no players are available to play. then they can select other lobbies with more/less number of players/contest
        - Less number of players (max 5) lobbies available during night/mid-night hours to show that actually there are real humans playing, not AI
